        Who's the 'we'? Most projects are undertaken by Matt, but naturally some larger projects require more minds. Developer City has a very select group of individuals that are called upon to work on larger projects. These individuals are the very best at what they do and work closely with Matt in order to produce an end product that creates a truly memorable experience for users.
