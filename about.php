        I am a designer/developer <a href="http://codingskyscrapers.com/2012/02/26/hybrid-people" title="Hybrid People" target="_blank">hybrid</a> who has been working in the internet industry since 2008. I started Developer City to provide a high quality service to design-conscious clients. I have since completed work for clients in both the UK and USA. I'm a big backer of the open-source movement and contribute to a number of <a href="https://github.com/matt-west" title="Matt West on GitHub" target="_blank">open-source projects</a>.

        Where's the 'we'? Developer City is just me (Matt West). Well most of the time... Most projects are solely completed by myself, but naturally some larger projects require more minds. I have a very select group of trusted individuals that I call upon to work with me on larger projects. These individuals are the very best at what they do and work closely with me in order to produce an end product that creates a truly memorable experience for the end user.
